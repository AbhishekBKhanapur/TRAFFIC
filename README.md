# Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System

## Description
This project analyzes traffic patterns using computer vision and AI techniques. It detects vehicles, monitors traffic flow, and provides real-time analytics to improve traffic management and planning. The system is designed for smart city applications and can help optimize road usage.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection and counting
- Traffic flow monitoring
- Alerts for congestion or abnormal traffic patterns
- Visualization of traffic density and movement
- Works with pre-recorded or live video feeds

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- MediaPipe / YOLO / TensorFlow (for vehicle detection)
- NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analytics visualization)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
